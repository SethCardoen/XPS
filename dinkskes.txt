Dinskes die we moeten doen....

no shift here from charging

- crop peaks more
- crop before the Shirley (first do Shirley again)

For voigt
- define peaks --> from numbers of database
- do voigt around it (with ofset of about 0.2)

xps database

Si peaks


C peaks
sp2: 284.4
sp3: 284.7
everything else: (around C-O-C) 285 some weird carbon compounds --> hydro carbons don't need to care
maybe another peak above 285 if that works
Don't take into account little bumb in 275, is just an artifact



O peaks
